# Bookhunt

Bookhunt is a mobile application that combines ideas from [Geocaching](https://www.geocaching.com/play) and [Bookcrossing](https://bookcrossing.com/), allowing users to hide and discover books in public places. Users create "bookdrops" by leaving books and logging their locations in the app, which others can then find using GPS coordinates and clues.

## Built with

* React Native
* Expo
* Firebase Firestore database
* [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api)

## Ideas for further development

* User authentication and linking bookdrops and books to users.
* Book log where user's can leave messages or notes to books for other users to read after they have collected the book.
* User history: what books have they collected and the bookdrops they have created and if those have been found or not.
* Cover images for books making them easier to recognise when "bookhunting".
